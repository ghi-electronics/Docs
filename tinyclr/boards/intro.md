# Boards Intro

While TinyCLR OS can be ported to other devices, we are providing a ready port for few popular boards.

One of the ports is for FEZ, which is the official TinyCLR OS board. It will always have the latest and greatest and should be used as a reference for new ports.

# Firmware Update
The firmware needs to be updated to match the assemblies loaded by Visual Studio. If you see an error messge about achecksum error then your project's assemblies verion does not match teh veriosn loaded on the device.

Each board will have details on how to load its firmware.
