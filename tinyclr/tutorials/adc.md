# ADC

Unlike digital input pins, which can only read high or low; analog pins can read a range of voltage levels.  Microcontrollers based on 3.3V can typically read voltages anywhere between zero and 3.3V. Analog inputs connect internally to a Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) that converts the analog voltage level on the pin to a digital value.

The resolution of the ADC determines its accuracy. An 8bit ADC has 256 steps to work with, 3.3V/256=0.013V. This means an increase of 0.013V will increase the value by one. In other words, a voltage change of less than 0.013V has no effect. The ADC on FEZ is 12bit and should fit most needs.

> [!Tip]
> Note that the analog channel number is not the pin number. We have these easily enumerated for FEZ but you need to determine the channel number on a specific pin using your system's documentation.

This example will read the ratio, that is 0 to 1, of an analog input. After running the program, connect a wire from the analog pin to ground and you should see a zero or something really close to zero. Connect to 3.3V and you will see 1 or something close, like 0.99.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Threading;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Adc;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        AdcController ADC = AdcController.GetDefault();
        AdcChannel analog = ADC.OpenChannel(FEZ.AdcChannel.A0);
        while(true)
        {
            double d = analog.ReadRatio();
            Debug.WriteLine("An-> " + d.ToString("N2"));
            Thread.Sleep(100);
        }
    }
}   
```
