You can just start coding everything from scratch. The easiest options would be to start with [**Mbed**](https://www.mbed.com) online tools and then export the project. Wither way, you can use free open-source GNU GCC tools to build your programs, which is what we use to build TinyCLR OS firmware. Another option is to use a commercial compiler, like Keil compiler/IDE. Keil tools are free for 32KB or less program size (MDK-Lite).

> [!Tip]
> If you are not adding a SWD-JTAG tool, like ST-Link, follow the [STM32 bootloader](../tinyclr/loaders/stm32_bootloader.md) instructions on generating and loading DFU files.
