MicroPython allows tiny systems to run Python 3, with a small subset of the standard library.
The STM32F4 is already one of available ports, making it easier to run MicroPython on FEZ.

This video shows the steps needed to use MicroPython on the FEZ (The FEZ and the BrainPad share the same processor).
