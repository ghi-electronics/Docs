# The STM32 Bootloader
---
The STM32 Bootloader lives on all STM32 chips. The bootloader is used to load files (bootloaders and/or firmware) onto the chip.

These instructions apply to all STM32 chips with built in USB and DFU features.

## Loading the GHI Bootloader v2
The bootloader often comes pre-installed on our devices. It only needs to be installed once. It does not need to be reinstalled unless it becomes erased or corrupted.
1. Download and save the latest [bootloader file](ghi-bootloader.md).
2. Download and install the [DfuSe USB device firmware upgrade software](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32080.html#getsoftware-scroll) from ST Microelectronics.
3. Run the `DfuSeDemo` program installed in the previous step. It should appear in the programs menu under `STMicroelectronics`.
4. Put your board in DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) mode. Instructions for putting your device in DFU mode are found on the documents page for the board you are using. `STM Device in DFU Mode` should now appear under `Available DFU Devices` at the upper left of the DfuSe Demo program screen.
5. Near the bottom of the DfuSe Demo program window click on the `Choose...` button. Find the bootloader file you saved in step 1 (...Bootloader v2.x.x.dfu), click on it and click on the `Open` button.
6. Now click on the upgrade button. If a dialog box appears with `Your device was plugged in DFU mode...` click the `Yes` button.
7. You should see a message at the bottom of the DfuSe Demo window saying the upgrade was successful. Now reset the your device or click on the `Leave DFU mode` button.
8. Congratulations! You have successfully installed the GHI STM32 bootloader!


## Creating a DFU file
> [!Tip]
> Creating DFU files are not necessary for most users. This is only provided as a reference for advanced used.

You can create DFU files from .hex or .bin files using the DFU file manager software which is part of the [DfuSe USB device firmware upgrade software](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32080.html#getsoftware-scroll) download from step 2 of the above instructions.

The instructions are slightly different depending on whether you are starting with a .hex or .bin file.

### From .hex files
1. Find and open the "Dfu file manager" program. It should appear in the programs menu under `STMicroelectronics`. Select `I want to generate a DFU file`.
2. Click on the `S19 or Hex...` button to select the .hex file.
3. Click `Generate...`
4. You now have a DFU file!

### From .bin files
1. Find and open the "Dfu file manager" program. It should appear in the programs menu under `STMicroelectronics`. Select `I want to generate a DFU file`.
2. Click on `Multi BIN...` button to select the .bin file.
3. Change the address to 08000000
4. Click on the `Add to list >>` button then click the `OK` button.
5. Click `Generate...`
6. You now have a DFU file!
