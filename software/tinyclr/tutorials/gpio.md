# General Purpose Input Output (GPIO)
---
Microcontrollers include pins that can be controlled through software. They can be inputs or outputs, hence the name "general purpose input/output," or GPIO for short.

> [!Tip]
> GPIO is handled by using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio through the NuGet Devices package.

## Digital Outputs
A digital output pin can be set to either high or low. There are different ways of describing these two states. High can also be called "true" or "one;" low can be called "false" or "zero".
If the processor is powered from 3.3V, then the state high means that there is 3.3V on the output pin. It is not going to be exactly 3.3V but very close. When the pin is set to low, it's voltage will be very close to zero.

> [!Warning]
> Never connect two output pins together. If they are connected and one is high and the other is low, the entire processor can be damaged.

> [!Warning]
> Digital pins on microcontrollers are weak. They can only be used to control small LEDs or transistors. Those transistors can, in turn, control devices with high power needs like a motor.

This example will blink an LED on the FEZ.

```csharp
using System.Threading;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio;

class Program {
    private static void Main() {
        var led = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(
            GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins.FEZ.GpioPin.Led1);
        led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output);

        while (true) {
            led.Write(GpioPinValue.High);
            Thread.Sleep(100);
            led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low);
            Thread.Sleep(100);
        }
    }
}

```

The previous example uses the FEZ pins class that enumerates all pins available on the FEZ. To blink an LED on hardware that does not have a pins class, you must use the GPIO pin's number to refer to it. This example can work on any STM32 chip.  As every port has 16 pins, we calculate the pin number as shown.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins;

class Program {
    private static void Main() {
        var led = GpioController.GetDefault().OpenPin(
        //PinNumber('E', 2));     //Buggy bot right flash
        //PinNumber('C', 4));     //Buggy bot left flash
        //PinNumber('C', 12));    //mini M4
        //PinNumber('B', 2));     //Cerbuino
        //PinNumber('A', 1));     //clicker
        //PinNumber('E', 12));    //clicker2
        //PinNumber('E', 15));    //Quail
        //PinNumber('A', 10));    //netduino 3
        //PinNumber('D', 5));     //411 red Discovery
        //PinNumber('D', 15));    //411 blue Discovery
        PinNumber('B', 9));     //FEZ LED1 (same as below)
        //STM32F4.GpioPin.PB9);   //FEZ LED1

        led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output);

        while (true) {
            led.Write(GpioPinValue.High);
            Thread.Sleep(100);
            led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low);
            Thread.Sleep(100);
        }
    }

    private static int PinNumber(char port, byte pin) {
        if (port < 'A' || port > 'E') throw new ArgumentException();

        return ((port - 'A') * 16) + pin;
    }
}

```

## Digital Inputs
Digital inputs sense the state of an input pin based on its voltage. The pin can be high or low. Every pin has a maximum and minimum supported voltage. For example, the typical minimum voltage on most pins is 0 volts; a negative voltage may damage the pin or the processor. Also, the maximum that can be applied to most pins must be less than or equal to the processor's power supply voltage. Since most processors run on 3.3V, the highest voltage a pin should see is 3.3V. However, some processors that are powered by 3.3V are 5V tolerant -- they can withstand up to 5V on their inputs. The FEZ is 5V tolerant.

> [!Warning] 
> 5V tolerant doesn't mean the processor can be powered by 5V, only that the input pins can tolerate 5V.

Unconnected input pins are called "floating." They are in a high impedance state and are susceptible to surrounding noise which can make the pin read high or low. A resistor can be added to pull the pin high or low. Modern processors include internal pull-down or pull-up resistors that are controlled by software. Note that a pull-up resistor doesn't necessarily make a pin high -- something connected to the pin can still pull it low.

In this example, a button is connected between ground and an input pin. We will enable the pull-up resistor making that pin high when the button is not pressed.  When the button is pressed it will overpower the pull-up and make the input low. We will read the status of the button and pass its state to an LED. 

> [!Tip]
> Never use an infinite loop without giving the system time to think. Add a short sleep to the loop or use events instead.

```csharp
using System.Threading;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins;

class Program {
    private static void Main() {
        var gpio = GpioController.GetDefault();
        var led = gpio.OpenPin(FEZ.GpioPin.Led1);
        led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output);

        var button = gpio.OpenPin(FEZ.GpioPin.Btn1);
        button.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.InputPullUp);

        while (true) {
            if (button.Read() == GpioPinValue.Low) {
                //Button is pressed.
                led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low);
            }
            else {
                led.Write(GpioPinValue.High);
            }
            Thread.Sleep(10);   //Always give the system time to think!
        }
    }
}

```

## Digital Input Events

In the previous example the program looped forever.  The input attached to the button was checked during each iteration of the loop. The pin may be checked millions of times before the button is pressed! This method of checking inputs is called "polled input."

Using events to check an input instead of polling the input is often preferred. Once an event is set up it will automatically check the input on its own, freeing up the program to do other things. Also, it is possible to miss a change in input if you don't check (or poll) the input often enough. Events use interrupts to check inputs so you don't have to worry about missing anything.

When an event occurs, the program stops what it is doing and control is transferred to an event handler. An event handler is code you write that responds to the event. 

Let's use event driven programming to respond to a button and turn an LED on and off. We will raise an event when the value on the button's input pin changes because the button is pressed or released.

You will see a reference to a "falling edge" in the following code. A falling edge occurs when the state of a pin goes from high to low. A rising edge is just the opposite -- it occurs when a pin goes from low to high.

This is a button controlled LED using events.

```csharp
using System.Threading;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins;

class Program {
    private static GpioPin led;
    private static void Main() {
        var gpio = GpioController.GetDefault();

        led = gpio.OpenPin(FEZ.GpioPin.Led1);
        led.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.Output);

        var button = gpio.OpenPin(FEZ.GpioPin.Btn1);
        button.SetDriveMode(GpioPinDriveMode.InputPullUp);
        button.ValueChanged += Button_ValueChanged;

        Thread.Sleep(-1);   //Sleep to reduce power use and allow system to do other tasks.
    }

    private static void Button_ValueChanged(GpioPin sender, GpioPinValueChangedEventArgs e) {
        if (e.Edge == GpioPinEdge.FallingEdge)
            led.Write(GpioPinValue.Low);
        else
            led.Write(GpioPinValue.High);
    }
}

```

## UCM Standard Pins
The [UCM Standard](../../../hardware/ucm/standard.md) provides a consistent mapping of pins to enable easily swapping out the underlying SoM. While the standard assigns a consistent name to each pin, the underlying pin on the processor is different, so it is helpful to use the `UCMStandard` class available in the `GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins.UCM` library. Once you specify the device model to use, it will map the pins for you automatically. For example:

```csharp
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Pins;
using GHIElectronics.TinyCLR.Devices.Gpio;

class Program {
    private static void Main() {
        UCMStandard.SetModel(UCMModel.UC5550);

        var controller = GpioController.GetDefault();
        var pin = controller.OpenPin(UCMStandard.GpioPin.A);
    }
}
```
