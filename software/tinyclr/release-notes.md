# Release Notes

## 1.0.0 on 2018-12-27

### Notes
We're happy to release the first production-ready version of TinyCLR OS, our modern and managed .NET development system for tiny IoT and embedded devices that uses the world-class Microsoft Visual Studio with C# and Visual Basic. TinyCLR can be used commercially on our System on Modules but you can also port it to your own system, free of charge, using our prebuilt cores for ARM7, ARM9, Cortex M3, Cortex M4, and Cortex M7 and the freely available GCC compiler. We're already hard at work on the next release where we plan to bring even more features that make embedded development even faster and easier.

The libraries, extension, and firmwares are all uploaded to their online sources so you can update your firmware using TinyCLR Config, update your packages using the NuGet package manager with the NuGet.org source, and update the VSIX from the extensions area of Visual Studio. To get going, take a look at the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide.

## 1.0.0-preview3 on 2018-11-30

### Notes
This release is the third and final planned preview of the 1.0 release for TinyCLR. There have been no major changes in this release -- its entire focus was bug fixing. We'll wait a few weeks to ensure no major issues are discovered before rebuilding with the final release version numbers and doing the final release.

We are also maintaining our decision to keep throwing an exception when `.constrained` is encountered instead of potentially allowing silent and incorrect behavior. It is currently known to be used when accessing overridden members on structs, particularly those from object like `ToString`, `Equals`, and `GetHashCode`. You'll encounter it on `enum` and `TimeSpan`, among others.

The libraries, extension, and firmwares are all uploaded to their online sources so you can update your firmware using TinyCLR Config, update your packages using the NuGet package manager with the NuGet.org source, and update the VSIX from the extensions area of Visual Studio (make sure to include pre-releases for NuGet as this is still a preview). We will still make these binaries available on our own hosting as well, but the expected workflow remains the usual NuGet/marketplace search and download process you have for other packages and extensions. You can find all downloads in their respective sections on the [downloads](downloads.md) page.

## 1.0.0-preview2 on 2018-09-28

### Notes
This release is the second preview of the 1.0 release for TinyCLR. It also marks the point where we are feature complete for 1.0! If we do another preview release, it'll just be a bug fix release. The biggest change in this release is the addition of a managed graphics provider and the initial release of some drivers for common chips (like the one on our old N18 display). There are also several usability tweaks to SPI and the three signals classes.

To support uploading to the Visual Studio gallery, we had to change the package ID used by the project system extension. This means the old one will not get uninstalled when installing this release, so please uninstall the preview1 or older extensions manually.

We're also releasing a tool to convert desktop TrueType fonts to the format used by TinyCLR. Keep in mind there are legal implications to using and distributing fonts and that we cannot provide advice on that. The tool used to convert binary files to `glb` and `ghi` files was also updated to support generating `UF2` files used by the BrainPad (which has its own new firmware in this release as well, available on https://brainpad.com/).

The UC2550 and UC5550 now come in a `glb` format instead of the old `ghi` format and you can find their device definitions in the ports repo as well. There is also a new bootloader for the UC5550 available on the [bootloader page](loaders/ghi-bootloader.md).

We have decided to keep throwing an exception when `.constrained` is encountered instead of potentially allowing silent and incorrect behavior. It is currently known to be used when accessing overridden members on structs, particularly those from object like `ToString`, `Equals`, and `GetHashCode`. You'll encounter it on `enum` and `TimeSpan`, among others.

The libraries are once again uploaded to our [NuGet account](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ghielectronics). Make sure to enable finding prereleases in the NuGet package manager. We've also uploaded the extension to the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ghielectronics.tinyclr-projectsystem) so you can download and install it from there and then keep it up to date with Visual Studio. We will still make them available on our own hosting as well, but the expected workflow remains the usual NuGet/marketplace search and download process you have for other packages and extensions. You can find all downloads in their respective sections on the [downloads](downloads.md) page. As before, you can update your firmware using TinyCLR Config and now you can update your packages using the NuGet package manager from the online source.

## 1.0.0-preview1 on 2018-08-15

### Notes
This release is the first preview of the 1.0 release for TinyCLR. We will have at least one other preview after this one. The biggest change in this release is the rework and simplification of the devices library. It was divided into one library per peripheral to reduce deployment size for apps that don't require all libraries. We did keep the devices package as a metapackage that depends on the other packages so you can easily bring them all into your project if desired.

Many of the devices did keep a familiar API like ADC, DAC, and GPIO. Others like I2C and SPI did keep a similar device API but the controller was reworked. Previously you'd be able to call `FromId` on the device or controller object. Now you must call `FromName` on the controller and then call `GetDevice`. A few others had minor tweaks to names and members. Of particular note are that you must now call `Enable` to turn the display on and mounting with `FileSystem` now requires the `Hdc` property from the `SdCardController` instead of the controller instance itself.

UART saw a lot of changes in this release. The entire storage library was removed and the `SerialCommunication` class was changed into `UartController` to mirror the pattern used with all of the other devices. `DataReader` and `DataWriter` are gone as well, so reading and writing to UART can only be done with a byte array.

We also introduced a new native library that holds many of the things we added to `mscorlib` previously like interops, APIs, system time, `NativeEventDispatcher`, and, new in this release, power.

Given the amount of changes in the HAL layer we do expect a few more bugs in this release, but we are working to iron them all out before 1.0.

`.constrained` continues to throw in this release as we gather more data. It is currently known to be used when accessing overridden members on structs, particularly those from object like `ToString`, `Equals`, and `GetHashCode`. You'll encounter it on `enum` and `TimeSpan`, among others. We will be making a decision soon on whether or not to revert the exception before the final release.

In preparation for the official 1.0 release we are no longer building the firmwares for older unsupported devices. Please see [this doc](http://docs.ghielectronics.com/software/tinyclr/supported-devices.html) for more information. The source code remains available though so we invite you to contribute to it and build your own firmware. We have also uploaded the libraries to our [NuGet account](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ghielectronics). Make sure to enable finding prereleases in the NuGet package manager. We will still make them available on our own hosting as well, but the expected workflow going forward is the usual NuGet search and download process you have for other packages and extensions. You can find all downloads in their respective sections on the [downloads](downloads.md) page. As before you, can update your firmware using TinyCLR Config and now you can update your packages using the NuGet package manager from the online source. There are no new bootloaders in this release.

- Many properties on `SignalGenerator` and `SignalCapture` do not work.
- `PulseFeedback` does not work.
- `SoftwareI2C` does not work [#365](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/365).
- `DisplayController.DrawBuffer` does not work with a non-zero origin or size different than the entire screen [#410](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/410).
- `DisplayController.DrawPixel` draws the incorrect color.
- The timestamp is incorrect when creating a new file.

### Firmware

#### Changes

- Fixed `OutputEnablePolarity` being inverted on UC5550 [#315](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/315).
- Fixed some SD cards getting corrupt after use on G400 [#319](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/319).
- Fixed G120 getting stuck deploying [#331](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/331).
- Fixed CAN not working on G400 [#332](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/332).
- Fixed the run app pin not working on USBizi [#333](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/333).
- Fixed paths requiring an extra `\` after the drive letter [#334](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/334).
- Fixed the display on the G400 reserving PC26 [#336](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/336).
- Removed the SPI display controller implementation.

#### Known Issues
- PWM may jitter when decreasing the pulse length while enabled.
- UART handshaking may miss data on STM32F4.
- Testing `NaN`s for equality gives unexpected results.
- `SignalGenerator` and `SignalCapture` do not work on UC2550 and UC5550.
- The UD700 will become corrupted after running for a few minutes on the UC5550.
- Using exception filters may crash the system in some uses [#177](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/177).
- Software SPI does not work with some devices [#293](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/293).
- During multi-pin reservations if a later pin fails to reserve, previously reserved ones are not released [#312](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/312).
- Filesystem is not available on G30 [#322](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/322).
- The ADC is not accurate on the G400 [#373](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/373).
- Many events do not pass a timestamp [#368](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/368).
- Many of the non-essential functions of USB client are not implemented [#398](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/398).
- Using UART may eventually lockup the UC5550 [#411](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Ports/issues/411).
