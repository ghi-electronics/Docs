USBizi was the first single chip .NET Micro Framework (NETMF) on the market. It was available in 100pin and 144pin LQFP packages.

We are no longer selling this chipset but we are making all [bootloader binaries](../../hardware/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md) available for free, including for commercial use. 

To use with NETMF, follow these [setup instructions](../../software/netmf/getting-started.md). Requires the NETMF 4.1 SDK.
