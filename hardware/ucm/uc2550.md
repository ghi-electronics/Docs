## Overview
The efficiency of our UC2550 makes it ideal for low power applications.  It is also our lowest cost UCM and offers a large complement of peripherals.

Pricing, purchasing and other information can be found on the [UC2550 Page](http://www.ghielectronics.com/products/ucm/uc2550) on our main website

> [!Tip]
> Modules designed for the UCM standard have more functionality available when not following the rules set by the standard. It is up to you to decide how much your design will follow the UCM standard.

## Development Options

![Development Options](../ucm/images/development-options.jpg)

The UCM [development options](development-options.md) can greatly simplify the process of building a product or prototype using the UC2550.  Options include a development board and displays which can get you programming in minutes.

> [!Tip]
> We are assuming you are using the UCM Development Board for all instructions provided.

## TinyCLR OS
TinyCLR OS provides a way to program the UC2550 in C# or Visual Basic from the Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment.  To get started you must first install the bootloader and firmware on the UC2550 (instructions below) and then go to the TinyCLR [Getting Started](../../software/tinyclr/getting-started.md) page for instructions.

### Loading Bootloader v2
1. Download the UC2550 bootloader [here](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md#uc2550).
2. Connect your device to the USB client port.
3. Put the board in DFU mode: Hold the SYS A pin low and press/release the reset button. Wait for a second then release SYS A. Windows *Device Manager* will now show "STM Device in DFU Mode" under the 'Universal Serial Bus controller' TAB.
4. Go to the [STM32 Bootloader](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/stm32-bootloader.md) to learn how to upload DFU files.

### Loading the Firmware

1. Activate the bootloader, hold the LDR0 signal (SYS B) low while resetting the board.
2. Open [TinyCLR Config](../../software/tinyclr/tinyclr-config.md) tool.
3. Click the loader tab.
4. Select the correct COM port. If you are not seeing it then the device is not in the loader mode.
5. Click the `Update to Latest` button.

You can also update the firmware manually. Download the [firmware](../../software/tinyclr/downloads.md) and learn how to use the [GHI Bootloader](../../software/tinyclr/loaders/ghi-bootloader.md) manually.

### Start Coding

Now that you have installed the bootloader and firmware on the UC2550, you can setup your host computer and start programming.  Go to the TinyCLR [Getting Started](../../software/tinyclr/getting-started.md) page for instructions.

### Code Samples

For some examples of using TinyCLR, take a look at the [TinyCLR Samples repo](https://github.com/ghi-electronics/TinyCLR-Samples). You may also find the [TinyCLR tutorials](../../software/tinyclr/tutorials/intro.md) useful.

### Native Code
You have the choice of loading the module with your preferred RTOS. Also, you can load [Native Code](../../software/tinyclr/native/intro.md) in TinyCLR OS at runtime that works alongside your managed application. Native code can be used to provide improved performance or access to advanced features.

The memory area reserved for native code in TinyCLR OS on UC2550 starts at 0x2003E000 and its length is 0x1FF8.

## WiFi Support
The WiFi module is made by STMicroelectronics. [this page](../components/spwf04sa.md) has further details.

## Schematic
The schematic for the UC2550 can be found [here](http://files.ghielectronics.com/downloads/Schematics/Systems/UC2550%20Rev%20C%20Schematic.pdf).

### Customization
We also offer customized, non-stock versions of our SoMs. Many options are available, such as various sizes of external QSPI flash. Please [contact us](http://ghielectronics.com/company/contact) for details. We will always do our best to provide you with a module to fit your exact needs.

## CAN Bit Timing Settings

The following CAN bit timing parameters were calculated for a UC2550 driving the SN65HVD230 CAN driver chip. See the [Configuring the Bus](../../software/tinyclr/tutorials/can.md#configuring-the-bus) section of the [CAN Tutorial](../../software/tinyclr/tutorials/can.md) for more information.
