# Imaging

ALCAM-OEM is a small yet powerful imaging hardware. It could capture stills and videos to SD card and able to fetch images using serial commands. It started in a successful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1359959821/alcam-oem)

We have worked on similar custom commercial designs with imaging needs but decided to proceed with a one-size-fits-all. Please contact us to discuss your imaging needs.
