With the rapid advance of technology it can be hard to stay current.  We take pride in our support of past products while we work hard to provide our customers with the best new technology.

Legacy product should not be used for new designs; however, many of our older products can still be produced (minimum order may be required).

Please [contact us](https://www.ghielectronics.com/contact) for information on the production of legacy products or the recommended path to upgrade to current or planned products.
